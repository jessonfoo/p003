# Review

You've learned a lot of diverse material in Phase 0, and now you are two weeks away from Phase 1. We hope you're excited! These weeks will have a lot of review and more options for how to spend your time. Take the time you need to review important concepts. 

This is your curriculum for the last two weeks. You'll be required to guide your own learning based on your interests.

## Submitting your work
**You need to submit your work through on [apply.devbootcamp.com](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) by Sunday at 11:59pm. When you log in, look at your profile page. There will be a "Unit 3 Week 8 Submission" and "Unit 3 Week 9 Submission" forms.**

## Sync DBC's Changes
####It's time to sync changes from DevBootcamp's phase_0_unit_3 master repo.
You'll need to fetch changes into your `phase_0_unit_3` repository from DevBootcamp's master repo to get the new curriculum. You'll be syncing your local repo with the repo on github.com.

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/fetching_changes.md)!
Modify them for unit 3.

You will want to run and modify all files from your local repository on your computer. Use the terminal to navigate to the various challenge directories and submit your solutions as directed. 

When you make updates to the files (or add a file), you should commit your work the same way you did for your website through the app. Include a commit message that describes what you've changed.


## Remember your Unit Goals!
- Pair at least once each week with a member of your accountability group.  *You need to pair **4** times this unit*
- Give feedback for each person you paired with. *You need to submit at least 5 pieces of feedback in this unit* (4 for peer-pairing, and 1 GPS)
- Rate at least 7 pieces of [Meta Feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback) per week on Socrates. *You need to rate 20 pieces of feedback per unit.*

## Link Issues in the Repository
You now know enough to fix broken links in your repo! If you run into a 404 error navigating through the directory online, go to the file where the error is, see what the link is. Is it to an internal or external file? If internal, do you see a file named something similarly in the repo? If so, you'll want to figure out why the link is broken and fix it. If it's to an external resource,  Definitely let us know if a link is broken so we can fix it, but take some time to research it as well.
