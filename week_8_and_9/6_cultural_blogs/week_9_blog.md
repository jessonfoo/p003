### Option 1: Revisit EQ: Feedback 

Revisit [EQ & Feedback](http://vimeo.com/76762772) and read:
- [How to Give Feedback that Works](http://www.forbes.com/sites/prettyyoungprofessional/2011/05/16/how-to-give-feedback-that-works/)
- [Receive Feedback with Grace and Dignity](http://humanresources.about.com/cs/communication/ht/receivefeedback.htm)
- [Find the Coaching in Criticism](http://hbr.org/2014/01/find-the-coaching-in-criticism/ar/1)

Consider the feedback you've given and received on Feedbackinator. When was it most useful? When was it less useful? How did feedback either reinforce or encourage you to modify behavior when pairing? Does feedback always have to be negative? How can you give meaningful positive feedback?


When you arrive at DBC, you'll be expected to give live feedback to your peers, so consider some strategies for giving and receiving live feedback. 

### Option 2: Your thinking style

Remember your [Gregorc Thinking Style](http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm) from your pre-Phase 0 work? If you can't remember what you are, retake the [personal thinking style](http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html) quiz. 

Now research your thinking style and consider how you can use your understanding of your thinking style to your advantage at DBC.

Consider your experience in Phase 0 to this point. What has been the biggest struggle for you? Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else. If it's related to your learning style, start thinking of strategies to help you. Put some plans of action in place.
