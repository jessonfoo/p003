- Identify database relationships including one to many, many to many, and one to one
- Write simple SELECT statements to extract data from one or more fields on a single table using the SELECT, FROM, WHERE, LIMIT, and ORDER BY keywords

## Summary:
I'm sure you have something you would like to itemize into a database. In this challenge, you will want to explore designing, implementing, and searching a database you create. 

## Release 0: Decide what you want to track
Come up with something that needs at least 2 tables. 

## Release 1: Design the Schema
Using [SQL Designer](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/sql), create a schema for your database. 

## Release 2: Add the schemas
Follow the instructions from [4_intro_to_SQLite](../../../week_7/4_intro_to_SQLite) to set up your database.

## Release 3: Join your tables
Research connecting your tables to one another. 

## Release 4: Enter Data
Enter some data for one of the tables. Make at least 10 entries.

## Release 5: [Reflect](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md) 
Put your reflection in the [my_reflection](my_reflection.md) file.

## Release 6: [Review](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/review.md)
