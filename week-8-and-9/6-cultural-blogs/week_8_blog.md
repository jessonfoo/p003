## Learning Competencies

## Release 0: New file

First, create a new HTML file named `week8_cultural_blog.html` in your [USERNAME].github.io website in the blog-posts directory. Copy the Code from your `blog_template`. 

## Release 1: Research Compass of Shame
Remember the [compass of shame](http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf)? Oftentimes when we have a conflict with someone we use one of our strategies for dealing with shame. 

Conduct some research on strategies for identifying the sources for conflict then discuss a time you had a conflict in your life. Identify the reason you had the conflict and whether your actions made it better or worse. 

## Release 2: Blog

Once you've opened your file, write a response to each exercise using the HTML you've learned to set up the file: 

1. Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened? 
2. What was the source of the conflict?
3. How did you handle that conflict? 
4. Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?
5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
6. What did you learn from this experience?
