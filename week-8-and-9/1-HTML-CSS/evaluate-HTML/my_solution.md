## Evaluate a Website! 
 
1) How does this website follow HTML Best Practices? Are there any places where 
it does not?  Provide examples of the "bad" code.
```
for the most part this website follows html best practices. However there are some areas that include
some bad practices. An example of bad practices include:
-use of inline styling
```
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="85%" bgcolor="#f6f6ef">
```
-not using h1-h6 headers

```

2) What do you think of the HTML? Did the writers use IDs and Classes properly? 
```
I think that the writers used IDS and Classes very well. Considering the simplicity of the website,
there wasn't much need for too many different Ids and Classes, yet their css was still very
all encompassing.
Did you like the way they used HTML tags?  Please use examples with your arguments.
 
3) How did the authors handle formatting? Did they include it in the HTML or 
separate it into a CSS file? Or did they do both?  Again, include examples.
 
4) Did the authors include anything you didn't immediately understand? 
If so, what?
 
5) How did the authors organize the CSS file? Was it DRY?
 
6) Did the authors incorporate any responsive design into the site?
 
7) What are your overall thoughts on the HTML/CSS from this website based on 
what you've read?
