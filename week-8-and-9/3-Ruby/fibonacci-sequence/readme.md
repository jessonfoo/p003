#U3.W8-9: Fibonacci Number?

## Learning Competencies
- Automate repetitive tasks using loops
- Determine which data structure (arrays or hashes) to use based on challenge requirements
- Find and use built-in Ruby methods to solve challenges

## Summary:
There are some interesting mathematical sequences that appear in nature. The [Fibonacci sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) is one of them. For this challenge, you will write a method to check if a number is part of that sequence. 

There are many ways to do this, but you'll first have to understand how the sequence is built. 

## Release 0: Run the [Tests](fibonacci_spec.rb)

## Release 1: Translate Rspec
Translate Rspec into Assert Statements or [Driver Test Code](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/driver-code.md)

## Release 2: Write [Pseudocode](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md)

## Release 3: Write your [initial solution](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/initial-solution.md)

## Release 4: [Refactor](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md)

## Release 5: [Reflect](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md)

## Release 6: [Review](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/review.md)
